### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Foxy-Lady74/Foxy-Lady74** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on making my life work for me!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning coding, and will be starting a bootcamp with Northcoders in September 2024.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything and everything that will help me learn and develop my skills.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with probably most stuff - this learning malarky is hard! ![image](https://github.com/Foxy-Lady74/Foxy-Lady74/assets/167773568/9a6ff59f-80bc-4096-8d72-b2bacfcb720f)

- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you want to know about me - I'm an open book, and honest!
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: foxylady495@gmail.com
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: use whatever you're comfortable with, makes no difference to me - although maybe not 'it' - that would be a little psychopathic!!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've abseiled the Spinnaker tower and jumped out of a plane, despite being scared of heights! ![image](https://github.com/Foxy-Lady74/Foxy-Lady74/assets/167773568/cf0c15b9-34d9-45df-8d68-b5975bbe22ad)

The way I view life is that everything is a lesson (although sometimes you can't see it until you look back) and that the only time you fail is the day you give up trying. The brain learns faster by getting things wrong! (Which is really good considering how many times things seem to go wrong in my life).
